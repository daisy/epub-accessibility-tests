    <p class="desc">This tests the useability and functionality of footnotes. The markup includes the semantics that the reference  is to   a note,which could be announced to the reader. The destination could be a footnote or an endnote  and announced to the reader. The link back to the original position has the semantics that it is a backlink and could also be announced to the reader.</p>

<p>To pass this test:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assistive technology is able to detect the reference to the footnote and reach  the content of the footnote.</li>
<li>Assistive technology is able to read the content of the footnote.</li>
<li>The Reading System  provides a mechanism to move back to the original reading position from the footnote, or the backlink is used to return to the original position.</li>
</ul>
   
    <p class="eval">Indicate Pass or Fail.</p>

<p>Please put into the notes if the link to the note was announced, and upon reaching the destination  that it was a footnote. Include if the Reading System included its own mechanism to return to the original location or if the backlink was announced and used to return to the exact location.</p>
<h3>Sample Footnote testing   example</h3>
<p>
     Chief Joseph was a leader of the Nez Perce tribe, who resisted the U.S. government’s attempt to remove them from their ancestral lands in the Wallowa Valley of Oregon. In 1877, after a series of violent encounters with white settlers, Chief Joseph and his people decided to flee the U.S. and seek refuge in Canada, where they hoped to join the Lakota people under Sitting Bull. Along the way, they fought several battles with the U.S. Army, who pursued them relentlessly. Chief Joseph also drove a large herd of horses<a id="backlink-target" href="#ft2f" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, which he used for transportation and trade. He managed to lead his people across more than 1,000 miles of rugged terrain, reaching the border of Montana and Canada. However, he was surrounded by the army and forced to surrender, ending his remarkable journey of resistance and survival.
   </p>
<p>This is a filler paragraph to show there would be text between the note reference and the footnote.</p>
<aside id="ft2f" role="doc-footnote" epub:type="footnote">
   <p>
     1 The Appaloosa is a spotted horse breed that originated from the selective breeding practices of the Nez Perce tribe in the northwestern U.S. The Nez Perce valued the Appaloosa for its speed, endurance, intelligence, and spiritual power. The name Appaloosa may have derived from the Palouse River or the Palouse tribe, which were associated with the Nez Perce. The Appaloosa is the official state horse of Idaho and a symbol of the region </p>

      <figcaption>Figure 2.3 caption: The synapse is the site where chemical signals pass between neurons. Neurotransmitters are released from the presynaptic neuron terminals into the extracellular space, the synaptic cleft or synaptic space. The
        released neurotransmitter molecules can then bind to specific receptors on the postsynaptic neuron to elicit a response. Excess neurotransmitter can then be reabsorbed into the presynaptic neuron through the action of specific reuptake
        molecules called transporters. This process ensures that the signal is terminated when appropriate. </figcaption>

    <p class="desc">Screen readers and other Assistive Technology that use TTS should be able to detect language changes marked in XHTML content. A screen reader should be able to be configured to automatically change the TTS speaking language when it encounters a language change in the XHTML. This test contains English, German, French, and Italian.</p>

<p> Configure your screen reader or other Assistive Technology to automatically change the TTS language. Read the phrases below line by line and continuously. The test passes if the TTS language changes as it encounters the language change.</p>

    <p class="eval">Indicate Pass or Fail.</p>
