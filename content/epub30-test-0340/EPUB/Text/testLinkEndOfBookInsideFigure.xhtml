    <h2>Notes about techniques</h2>
    <p>In this chapter the extended description is placed at the end of the book as a single file with one description per file. It is expected that this approach will appeal to publishers that do not want the descriptions to impact the appearance of the content. The approaches have the lowest impact on the visual layout. The bar chart has a text link. A link back to the image is provided to take the reader back to the same location where they left off reading in the primary flow of content. This test places the link within the Figure Element</p>

 
    <p>The test below refers to the bar chart image immediately following.</p>
    
    <section id="extdesc-250" class="test">
      <h2><span class="test-id">extdesc-250</span> <span class="test-title">Technique for linking to extended description via text hyperlinks to the end of the book from within the figure element and back</span><br/></h2>
      <div class="desc">
        <p>This test passes if all the following steps are successful:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The link "Follow for extended description" is reported, and on activating, it takes the focus to extended description at end of this book. The extended description is placed under the heading "Description of Bar Chart" </li>
          <li>Upon activation of the link you are taken to the image description directly instead of being placed at the top of the page and can read the extended description</li>
          <li>On activating the link "Navigate back to Bar Chart image" below the extended description, it takes the focus back to original position in this chapter.</li>
        </ul>
          
        <p>The image itself has "aria-details" pointing to the link which points to the extended description. Please add to the Notes field how this is handled with the assistive technology (AT) you are using. For example does your AT say anything (i.e. "Has Details"), does your AT provide some way to move the keyboard focus to the link or does your AT allow you to directly activate the link from the image etc.</p>
