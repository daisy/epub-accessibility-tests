    <p>The above heading should not have run into this text as if it were one sentence. Now we have a regular sentence that includes a comma, so it should be spoken as two phrases. And a pause should have indicated that this is a separate sentence.

    <p>This is a new paragraph. Below is a list, which should be read as three separate groups:</p>
