    <p>Paragraph: The site where a presynaptic terminal ends in close proximity to a receiving dendrite is called the <dfn epub:type="keyword">synapse</dfn>. The cell that sends out information is called the<dfn epub:type="keyword">presynaptic</dfn>
      neuron, and the cell that receives the information is called the <dfn epub:type="keyword">postsynaptic</dfn> neuron. The intercellular space between the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons is called the <dfn epub:type="keyword">synaptic
        space</dfn> or <dfn epub:type="keyword">synaptic cleft</dfn>. An average neuron forms approximately 1,000 synapses with other neurons. It has been estimated that there are more synapses in the human brain than there are stars in our galaxy.

      <figcaption>Figure 2.3 caption: The synapse is the site where chemical signals pass between neurons. Neurotransmitters are released from the presynaptic neuron terminals into the extracellular space, the synaptic cleft or synaptic space. The
        released neurotransmitter molecules can then bind to specific receptors on the postsynaptic neuron to elicit a response. Excess neurotransmitter can then be reabsorbed into the presynaptic neuron through the action of specific reuptake
        molecules called transporters. This process ensures that the signal is terminated when appropriate. </figcaption>

    <p>Paragraph: The brain contains another class of cells called glia. There are as many as 10 to 50 times more glial cells than neurons in the central nervous system. Glial cells are categorized as microglia or macroglia. Microglia are phagocytic
      cells that are mobilized after injury, infection, or disease. They are derived from macrophages and are unrelated to other cell types in the nervous system. </p>

      <h2 id="sidebar-heading">Sidebar: The Blood-Brain Barrier</h2>
      <p>The blood-brain barrier protects the neurons and glial cells in the brain from substances that could harm them. Endothelial cells that form the capillaries and venules make this barrier, forming impermeable tight junctions. </p>
      <p>Astrocytes surround the endothelial cells and induce them to form these junctions. Unlike blood vessels in other parts of the body that are relatively leaky to a variety of molecules, the blood-brain barrier keeps many substances, including
        toxins, away from the neurons and glia.</p>
