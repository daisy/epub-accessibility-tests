      <h2>About this Document</h2>
      <p>This document contains tests which are important to the accessibility of Reading Systems for users with disabilities. This is one test book in a suite of EPUBs for testing accessibility; the other books cover additional fundamental tests
        as well as advanced and experimental tests.</p>
      <p>A reading system with fundamental accessibility should support reading by eyes, ears or fingers. This means it should be possible for users to read the content of this document by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>adjusting the display, such as adjusting font size and color combination</li>
        <li>reading the text with screen readers and read aloud</li>
        <li>reading the text with a refreshable Braille display</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Performing the tests </h2>
      <p>The Reading Systems will be evaluated by various testers using different combinations of platforms and assistive technologies. There will be different sets of test results for each combination. Testers may perform the tests given in this
        book using keyboard, mouse or touch/gestures as input.</p>
      <p>Each test includes a description of its purpose followed by the actual test statement, which can be evaluated to pass or fail.</p>
      <p>The results from the Fundamental test books are recorded on the epubtest.org website. Test results from advanced and experimental tests assist in evaluations and developer feedback. As support for a feature improves,  tests that were advanced or experimental are moved to the fundamental test book.</p>
